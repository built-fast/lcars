**lcars** [*OPTION*] *COMMAND* [*ARGS*...]

**lcars** **\-\-help** | **-h**

**lcars** **\-\-root**

# DESCRIPTION

LCARS is a comprehensive CLI toolkit designed specifically for Laravel development workflows. It combines Laravel-specific application management tools with general development utilities for testing, system inspection, cryptographic operations, and productivity enhancements.

The command structure follows a clear namespace pattern with colons separating categories from specific actions, making it easy to discover and organize related functionality.

# OPTIONS

**-h**
:   Print short help and exit.

**\-\-help**
:   Print full help text and exit. Same as `lcars help`.

**\-\-root**
:   Print the root directory that LCARS is installed to and exit.

# COMMANDS

## Application Management (app:)

Laravel application integration for development and deployment tasks:

**app:artisan** [*command*] [*arguments*...]
:   Interactive Laravel Artisan command launcher with fuzzy search. When called without arguments, presents a searchable list of all available Artisan commands. Use arrow keys to navigate, type to filter, press '?' for help preview, and Enter to execute.

**app:console**
:   Opens the Laravel Tinker REPL console for interactive PHP evaluation.

**app:decrypt** [*data*]
:   Decrypts input data using Laravel's encryption service. Reads from stdin if no data provided.

**app:encrypt** [*data*]

**app:reset**
:   Fully resets the application database, runs migrations, and clears all caches. Use with caution.

**app:new** *app-name* [*options*]
:   Creates a new Laravel application with sensible defaults including Pest/PHPUnit for testing, Pint for code formatting, and Larastan for static analysis. Supports database selection (sqlite, mysql, mariadb, pgsql, sqlsrv), test framework choice (pest, phpunit), Pint mode (standard, strict), PHPStan level (0-9), and optional Laravel Sail removal.

**app:root**
:   Prints the Laravel application root directory path.

## CLI Management (cli:)
